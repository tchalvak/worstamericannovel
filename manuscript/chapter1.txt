# Chapter 1 
It was a dark and stormy night.  The only thing darker than the sky outside was the hearts of the men inside.  It was a little past the witching hour, and with the rain, anyone who had worthy business was asleep or inside.  So that leaves everyone else.

The rain dripped and splattered down on three figures under the eaves.  Sometimes one of the two men would jockey for position, moving a little closer to the driest point near the doorway.  They huddled, but not too close.  The woman just stood there, taking up the driest space, implacable, immovable.
The tall, thin man had soaked boots and pants, and a hunter green jacket covered in beads of water.  He lit a cigarette, as tiny rivers wended their way down his coat and splashed in the wetland of his pants and boots.


Viv - Just wants to get out of this alive, and get Jamie out alive, and Michael, she supposes.  Fuck Jeb, he's on his own.
Michael - Is obsessed with heights and flying.
Jeb - Violence, it really works for him, what can he say?
